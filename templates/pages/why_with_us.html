        <p class="text-justify">When it comes to experience  we have not less than 5 year experience and summited twice and When it comes to scaling the peaks, dangers are plenty. Although the mountains seem serene and gentle from a distance, the weather there is treacherous. The terrain can be downright unforgiving and to have someone accompanying you, who has been tested by the mountains time and again and have come victorious through and through, can be the greatest of advantages. Our guides, Sherpas and team leaders have years and years of experience in mountaineering, and understand the whims of Himalayas, as much as it’s humanly possible. Over the years, they have been trained to coordinate in a hostile terrain and take immediate actions. It is something a recently established, youth startups cannot offer. Less demanding adventures and activities also comes with their risk. But our staffs are always well prepared.</p>

We are a supporter of sustainable tourism and believe that the present generation should utilize the resources without compromising the ability of coming generations to do the same. Of course, that doesn’t affect our ability to fulfill our guest’s need in any way.
